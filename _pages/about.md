I'm a **data scientist** with an academic fervor. I use my technical background to solve problems in the field of **psychology** and **cognitive sciences**. Currently, I'm mainly dealing with my doctoral dissertation entitled: **Relationships between rhythmic eye movements and oscillatory brain activity**.
However, my scientific interests are much broader, so I encourage you to check my **blog**.

In my free time, I am a salsa teacher and I run a dance school in my hometown. <a href="http://www.forumtanca.pl">Fell free to check us :) </a>

I am also an amateur powerlifter, one day I will compete!
