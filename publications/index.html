      <p>Despite the growing emphasis on embedding interactive social paradigms in the field of cognitive and affective neuroscience, the impact of socially induced emotions on cognition remains widely unknown. The aim of the present study was to fill this gap by testing whether facial stimuli whose emotional valence was acquired through social learning in an economic trust game may influence cognitive performance in a subsequent stop-signal task. The study was designed as a conceptual replication of previous event-related potential experiments, extending them to more naturalistic settings. We hypothesized that response inhibition to briefly presented faces of negative and positive game partners would be enhanced on the behavioral and neural levels as compared to trials with a neutral player. The results revealed that the trust game was an effective paradigm for the induction of differently valenced emotions towards players; however, behavioral inhibitory performance was comparable in all stop-signal conditions. On the neural level, we found decreased P3 amplitude in negative trials due to significantly stronger activation in the right frontoparietal control network, which is involved in theory-of-mind operations and underlies social abilities in humans, especially memory-guided inference of others’ mental states. Our findings make an important contribution to the cognition-emotion literature by showing that social interactions that take place during an economic game may influence brain activity within the mentalizing network in a subsequent cognitive task.</p>

      <p>A  widespread  tool  in analogy  researchconsists  ofmultiple-choice  tests  that  require  identifying  a  relation  between  two situations and mappingitto another two situations,to find thecorrect responseoption.A keysource of difficulty duringsuchtests is attributed to the complexity of mapping. However, most people do not construct mappingspurely in themind, but also compare  the emerging mapping  with  the existing response options, so theirfeatures may affect the reasoning process. This studyexamined the impact of relational match of error options with  respect  tothe  correct  option (the  proportion  of  correct elements  present  in  a  given  error  option) on  theoption selection. Results indicate that option selectiondependsalmost linearly on therelational match.Moreover, the higher working memory  capacityof  the  participants,  the  more  relationally matching errors they select.The studysuggests careful design of error options in multiple-choice reasoning tests, because thepattern of these optionscanaffect the solutionprocess.</p>

      <p>Prior affective and social knowledge about other individuals has been shown to mod-
ulate perception of their faces and gaze- related attentional processes. However, it re-
mains unclear whether emotionally charged knowledge acquired through interactive 
social learning also modulates face processing and attentional control. Thus, the aim 
of this study was to test whether affective knowledge induced through social interac-
tions in a naturalistic exchange game can influence early stages of face processing 
and attentional shifts in a subsequent gaze- cueing task. As indicated by self- reported 
ratings, the game was successful in inducing valenced affective knowledge towards 
positive and negative players. In the subsequent task, in which the locations of fu-
ture targets were cued by the gaze of the game players, we observed enhanced early 
neural activity (larger amplitude of the P1 component) in response to a photograph 
of the negative player. This indicates that negative affective knowledge about an 
individual indeed modulates very early stages of the processing of this individual’s 
face. Our study contributes to the existing literature by providing further evidence 
for the saliency of interactive social exchange paradigms that are used to induce af-
fective knowledge. Moreover, it extends the previous research by presenting a very 
early modulation of perception by socially learned affective knowledge. Importantly, 
it also offers increased ecological validity of the findings due to the use of naturalistic 
social exchange in the study design</p>

      <p>The well-known hypothesis of Sir Francis Galton (1883) posed that individual differences in performance on diverse sensorimotor tasks are rooted in single general sensory discrimination ability. Relatedly, Charles Spearman (1904) hypothesized that this discrimination ability and intelligence share the same neural basis and thus should be statistically equivalent. Despite a century of research, existing evidence for these 2 hypotheses is still inconclusive. Study 1 modeled the factor structure for, to date, the most comprehensive battery of tasks tapping into visual discrimination, and investigated its relationships with iconic and working memory, as well as intelligence. The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) models indicated that performance could be grouped into 2 considerably correlated, yet statistically separate factors reflecting temporal versus nontemporal (i.e., featural) sensory discrimination ability. These 2 abilities correlated considerably with working memory and intelligence but, at the same time, were clearly separable. However, the discrimination–intelligence link disappeared when mediated by working memory, suggesting that sensory discrimination plays no explanatory role in intelligence. In Study 2, the above findings were supported and extended by introducing auditory discrimination tasks. The results indicated 3 independent factors reflecting: amodal temporal discrimination, visual featural discrimination, and auditory featural discrimination. Working memory (WM) fully accounted for the shared variance among the three abilities and their relationships with intelligence. Overall, both Galton and Spearman validly guessed that various low-level sensorimotor processes can be mutually linked but, contrary to their ideas, sensory discrimination neither constitutes unitary ability nor is equivalent to intelligence. </p>

      <p>Participants rated Intuition, Suddenness, Pleasure, and Certainty accompanying their solutions to items of a popular fluid intelligence test – Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices (RAPM) – that varied from easy (around 80% correct) to difficult (around 20% correct). The same ratings were collected from four insight problems interleaved with RAPM. Suddenness and Certainty substantially decreased from easy to difficult matrices (Pleasure strongly overlapped with Certainty). In easy matrices, subjective experience matched that observed during insight problems, suggesting the highly fluent processing resulting in vivid and univocal solutions. By contrast, processing difficult matrices seemed to involve effortful incremental combination of complex information that yielded uncertain outcomes, resembling full-blown analytic problems. Only Intuition, generally rated low, was unaffected by RAPM difficulty. These results suggest that RAPM constitutes a heterogeneous test, with easy vs. difficult items involving relatively distinct types of processing. This novel knowledge can help in understanding the processes underlying solving Raven’s matrices. The study also contributes to the understanding of the validity of subjective ratings as measures of metacognition.</p>

      <p>Electrophysiological investigations have pointed out significant yet weak correlations between intelligence and oscillatory brain activity, including the spectral power, frequency, complexity, synchrony, and coherence of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, however neglecting the interplay between fast and slow neuronal oscillations underlying information transfer in the brain. We found that fluid intelligence level (gf) depends on the precise synchronization of fast oscillations to a specific time window of slow brain rhythms. Specifically, by examining EEG recordings of 50 people in resting state as well as during performance at two gf tasks we found converging evidence that high-gf participants display stronger Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) related to an increased concentration of gamma (  36 Hz) spectral power at the descending phase of delta oscillations (  3 Hz).</p>

      <p>The present study had three main objectives. First, we aimed to evaluate whether short-duration affective states induced by negative and positive words can lead to increased error-monitoring activity relative to a neutral task condition. Second, we intended to determine whether such an enhancement is limited to words of specific valence or is a general response to arousing material. Third, we wanted to assess whether post-error brain activity is associated with incidental memory for negative and/or positive words. Participants performed an emotional stop-signal task that required response inhibition to negative, positive or neutral nouns while EEG was recorded. Immediately after the completion of the task, they were instructed to recall as many of the presented words as they could in an unexpected free recall test. We observed significantly greater brain activity in the error-positivity (Pe) time window in both negative and positive trials. The error-related negativity amplitudes were comparable in both the neutral and emotional arousing trials, regardless of their valence. Regarding behavior, increased processing of emotional words was reflected in better incidental recall. Importantly, the memory performance for negative words was positively correlated with the Pe amplitude, particularly in the negative condition. The source localization analysis revealed that the subsequent memory recall for negative words was associated with widespread bilateral brain activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and in the medial frontal gyrus, which was registered in the Pe time window during negative trials. The present study has several important conclusions. First, it indicates that the emotional enhancement of error monitoring, as reflected by the Pe amplitude, may be induced by stimuli with symbolic, ontogenetically learned emotional significance. Second, it indicates that the emotion-related enhancement of the Pe occurs across both negative and positive conditions, thus it is preferentially driven by the arousal content of an affective stimuli. Third, our findings suggest that enhanced error monitoring and facilitated recall of negative words may both reflect responsivity to negative events. More speculatively, they can also indicate that post-error activity of the medial prefrontal cortex may selectively support encoding for negative stimuli and contribute to their privileged access to memory.</p>

      <p>The impact of emotions on higher level cognitive processes, such as memory, attention allocation, planning, and decision-making, has been reflected in the results of a wide range of studies. However, relatively less is known about emotion’s influence on response inhibition. This function refers to the ability to supress thoughts and actions that are inappropriate in a given context, and has crucial role in determining human behavior. The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of short-duration affective states induced by emotional words on response inhibition using event-related potentials.</p>

      <p>This EEG study (N=33) examined event-related potentials associated with conflict between activated responses in the Stroop task, in order to examine the conflict monitoring theory of cognitive control, which predicts the strength of exerted control to be proportional to the detected level of conflict. However, existing research manipulated the sole presence/absence of conflict, but not its exact level. Here, by using a modified color-word task that allowed multiple correct responses for target colors, as well as multiple incorrect responses for distractor words, we manipulated the level of conflict among activated responses (and not only its presence). We expected that a larger number of activated incorrect responses (i.e., a presumably higher conflict) would entail more pronounced conflict-related potentials.</p>

      <p>Spearman’s Law of Diminishing Returns (SLODR) holds that correlation between general (g)/fluid (Gf) intelligence factor and other cognitive abilities weakens with increasing ability level. Thus, cognitive processing in low ability people is most strongly saturated by g/Gf, whereas processing in high ability people depends less on g/Gf. Numerous studies demonstrated that low g is more strongly correlated with crystallized intelligence/creativity/processing speed than is high g, however no study tested an analogous effect in the case of working memory (WM). Our aim was to investigate SLODR for the relationship between Gf and WM capacity, using a large data set from our own previous studies. We tested alternative regression models separately for three types of WM tasks that tapped short-term memory storage, attention control, and relational integration, respectively. No significant SLODR effect was found for any of these tasks. Each task shared with Gf virtually the same amount of variance in the case of low-and high-ability people. This result suggests that Gf and WM rely on one and the same (neuro) cognitive mechanism.</p>
