  abstract={This EEG study (N=33) examined event-related potentials associated with conflict between activated responses in the Stroop task, in order to examine the conflict monitoring theory of cognitive control, which predicts the strength of exerted control to be proportional to the detected level of conflict. However, existing research manipulated the sole presence/absence of conflict, but not its exact level. Here, by using a modified color-word task that allowed multiple correct responses for target colors, as well as multiple incorrect responses for distractor words, we manipulated the level of conflict among activated responses (and not only its presence). We expected that a larger number of activated incorrect responses (i.e., a presumably higher conflict) would entail more pronounced conflict-related potentials.},

  abstract={Electrophysiological investigations have pointed out significant yet weak correlations between intelligence and oscillatory brain activity, including the spectral power, frequency, complexity, synchrony, and coherence of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, however neglecting the interplay between fast and slow neuronal oscillations underlying information transfer in the brain. We found that fluid intelligence level (gf) depends on the precise synchronization of fast oscillations to a specific time window of slow brain rhythms. Specifically, by examining EEG recordings of 50 people in resting state as well as during performance at two gf tasks we found converging evidence that high-gf participants display stronger Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) related to an increased concentration of gamma (~ 36 Hz) spectral power at the descending phase of delta oscillations (~ 3 Hz).},

  abstract={Spearman’s Law of Diminishing Returns (SLODR) holds that correlation between general (g)/fluid (Gf) intelligence factor and other cognitive abilities weakens with increasing ability level. Thus, cognitive processing in low ability people is most strongly saturated by g/Gf, whereas processing in high ability people depends less on g/Gf. Numerous studies demonstrated that low g is more strongly correlated with crystallized intelligence/creativity/processing speed than is high g, however no study tested an analogous effect in the case of working memory (WM). Our aim was to investigate SLODR for the relationship between Gf and WM capacity, using a large data set from our own previous studies. We tested alternative regression models separately for three types of WM tasks that tapped short-term memory storage, attention control, and relational integration, respectively. No significant SLODR effect was found for any of these tasks. Each task shared with Gf virtually the same amount of variance in the case of low-and high-ability people. This result suggests that Gf and WM rely on one and the same (neuro) cognitive mechanism.},
